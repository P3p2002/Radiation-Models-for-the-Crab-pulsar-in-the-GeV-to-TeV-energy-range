# Radiation-Models-for-the-Crab-pulsar-in-the-GeV-to-TeV-energy-range
This are the codes of my final degree thesis, which are about the models of radiation of Neutron Stars. I specially focused on the Crab pulsar and the GeV to TeV energy range.

In we can find various codes, which do different functions. The main code, whihch gives all the results is labelled as "Main_code", and the other codes should be in the same directory, for the main code to work properly. In a while a more detailed expalantion about the model in which all this code has been based upon, will also be uploaded.
